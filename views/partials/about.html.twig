      <h1>About Fearless Beauty</h1>

      <h1>Founder, Heather Packer</h1>
        <p>I am the founder and first teacher of Fearless Beauty. Over the past couple of years, I found that I was beginning to want something more from my career. I began to ask myself: Will I be content only cutting hair in the salon everyday for the rest of my life?</p>

        <p>Knowing that service is extremely important to me, I started looking into a master’s program in social work.  On my last trip to India in March 2014, I brought an application for a master’s in social work for NYU. That application was never filled out.</p>

        <p>Within days of arriving in India, on the banks of the Ganges River, after meditation, I asked myself: “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”</p>

        <p>In the answer to that question, Fearless Beauty was born. I realized then that I have a skill: I love teaching – it’s useful, universal, valuable…and there is a community in India, the Khushi Project that is ready to receive the teachings of hairdressing.</p>
